      Wanderers.io is a multiplayer game where you lead a tribe of tiny people through a hostile sandbox. You don't give direct orders to your minions - instead they interact with the objects in sight if they have the right tools - for example an axe will allow minion to cut down trees and a bow will let him hunt animals.

      The gameplay revolves around search for the meadows separated by barren land which are the main source of food and wood that you need to survive. Two main threats are AI controlled barbarians and tribes owned by other players. To help your minions in the battle you can exchange experience for new traits and upgrades which will cost you gold. After the battle you will be able to loot the corpses and heal wounds by the campfire.

      Currently the goal of the game is to get as high score as possible - which involve teaming up with other tribes to outnumber your foes. Within a few weeks the author wants to add new modes based on domination and match making as well as new characters such as wizards.

      There is a detailed tutorial page with GIFs explaining the gameplay

      I have also prepared GIF and PNG section for you.

      The game is a love letter to the classic productions featuring tiny folks such as Cannon Fodder, The Settlers, Mega-lo-mania, Lemmings.

      Plans
      There are plenty of ways I want to continue with this project if it turns out to be financially successful (otherwise I am going back to freelance). First of all I would like to make a spinoff set in SCI-FI setting. Then I am aiming at a simple multiplayer RTS featuring the same graphics style - a mix of C&C and "Z" games. If it all turns out well and I can afford establishing a small studio my ultimate goal is to create a city-builder in the spirit of Knights & Merchants.

      Tech
      > What engine are you using?

      I write everything from scratch in pure javascript. I am using WebGL as a rendering API. Server runs on node.js, database is PostgreSQL. Networking is brought to you by uWebsockets and msgpack. My coding software is Sublime Text running on Ubuntu. I manage and scale my servers with a bunch of bash scripts.

      > Is this 3D or 2D?

      From a technical point of view it's pure 2D. My art style is a mix of traditional pixelart and prerendered low poly models styled to look like pixelart. My art software includes Blender, Aseprite, GIMP and TimelineFX on Ubuntu Linux. I am using bunch of python, node.js and bash scripts that help me post-process graphics and optimize spritesheets.

      > What is your DAW

      I make music in FLStudio that works pretty fine through WINE.
